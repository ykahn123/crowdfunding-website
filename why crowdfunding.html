    <h2><b><u>Transparency and Accountability</u></b></h2>
	<ul>
    <p align = "justify"> <font size = "4">
        Crowdfunding is not only about raising funds; it’s about building trust and showing our backers exactly how their contributions are making an impact. Here’s how transparency and accountability play a central role in our crowdfunding campaign:
    </font></p>
    
    <h3><b><u><li>Clear Goals and Milestones</u></b></h3>
    <p align = "justify"><font size = "4">
        We’re committed to updating our supporters on each stage of the project—from initial planning to the purchase of equipment and final setup. This way, backers can see exactly where their money is going and how it directly contributes to the project’s success.
    </font></p>
    
    <h3><b><u><li>Regular Updates</u></b></h3>
    <p align = "justify"><font size = "4">
        Supporters will receive regular updates on our progress, challenges, and accomplishments. By staying informed, our backers become an integral part of our journey, sharing in both the obstacles and triumphs.
    </font></p>
    
    <h3><b><u><li>Impact Tracking</u></b></h3>
    <p align = "justify"><font size = "4">
        Once the gym is up and running, we’ll track its impact on student engagement, health, and productivity. We want our supporters to know how their contributions have improved students’ lives, creating a tangible sense of fulfillment and shared achievement.
    </font></p>
    
    <h3><b><u><li>Fostering Accountability</u></b></h3>
    <p align = "justify"><font size = "4">
        With each milestone and update, we’re held accountable to our goals. Crowdfunding allows us to stay transparent and open with our community, encouraging a higher level of trust and commitment from everyone involved.
		</ul>
    </font></p>
    <br/>
    
        <h3><b><i>Crowdfunding isn’t just about funding; it’s about creating a meaningful connection with our community. By keeping our supporters in the loop, we’re building a team of champions who are as invested in our school’s future as we are! </i></b></h3>
